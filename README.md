# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-Using-ML-Deep-Learning-Approach-
The technology used to enable machine recognition of human handwritten digits is known as handwritten digit recognition. Handwritten numerals are not accurate, differ from person to person, and can be generated in a variety of flavours, making it difficult for the computer to complete the task. So, we have built a new GUI file to generate an interactive window and use a Deep Learning model i.e CNNÂ to solve this problem. Drawing numbers on the canvas in this file allows you to identify them by clicking a button.
